##What Questions Are Answered?
The dashboard is designed to answer key questions about user behavior and demographic performance:

1.Overall Averages: What are the average Calories Burned, Daily Steps, Workout Duration, and Hours of Sleep across the entire user base?

2.Demographic Performance: Which Age Group (e.g., 36-50, 18-25) burns the most calories, or achieves the highest daily steps?

3.Gender Comparison: How do the average fitness metrics (e.g., Calories Burned) compare between Male, Female, and Other genders?

4.Dietary Effectiveness: Which Diet Preference (e.g., Keto, Vegan, Vegetarian) correlates with the highest or lowest average calories burned?

5.Activity Type Efficacy: Which Activity Type (e.g., Running, Gym, Yoga) results in the highest average calories burned and longest workout duration?

##What Insights Are Getting from This Dashboard?
By utilizing pivot tables to aggregate the data, the dashboard surfaces important comparative insights:

1)Peak Calorie Burners: The 36-50 Age Group appears to have the highest average calorie burn (1028.49), suggesting they might have the most intensive or frequent workouts.

2)Dietary Correlation: Users following a Vegan diet preference show a noticeably lower average calorie burn (920.89) compared to Non-Vegetarian (964.86) or Male (961.56) users, indicating a potential area for fitness guidance.

3)Gender Consistency: The average calorie burn between Female (970.08) and Male (961.56) users is remarkably similar, suggesting consistency in effort across genders.

4)Targeted Focus: The dashboard highlights specific demographic and behavioral groups (Age Groups, Diets) that may require tailored fitness program recommendations to optimize their health outcomes.
